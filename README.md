# csmidi
## Disclaimer
This repository is no longer maintained and I don't intend to work on it anymore.
It's old code, may be buggy and these days I don't program C# so much anymore.

I have a similar library for C++ with much cleaner code and probably less bugs called [cppmidi](https://github.com/ipatix/cppmidi).
So if you're familiar with C++, you should definitely check it out.

## About
"csmidi" is a library which I've used a couple of times for basic midi processing functions.
It's intended to not have a bulk of features to ease using it.
